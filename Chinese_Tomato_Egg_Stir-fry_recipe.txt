INGREDIENTS
▢4 small to medium tomatoes
(about 500 g, 1 pound)
▢1 scallion
▢4 eggs
▢3/4 tsp salt (divided, or to taste)
▢1/4 tsp white pepper
▢1/2 tsp sesame oil
▢1 tsp shaoxing wine
▢3 tbsp vegetable oil (divided)
▢2 tsp sugar
▢1/4-1/2 cup water

INSTRUCTIONS
Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.
Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.
Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.
Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions. Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). Add the cooked eggs.
Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.
Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!
